# Style Image selection in NST
The work conducted in [this paper](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/An-Approach-to-Style-Image-Selection-in-Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/main/Optimal_style_image_selection_in_Neural_Style_Transfer.pdf) takes a different approach compared to regular NST research, as it attempts to address a key practical challenge: selecting an appropriate style image.
It is investigated an optimal style identifier that automatically selects the most suitable style image from a predefined gallery.
Users can specify a general style category (e.g., “Picasso” or “cosmic”), and the identifier will determine the best image to achieve their desired result. 
By simplifying the style selection process, this approach relieves users from the burden of choice and possibly improves the output quality.
